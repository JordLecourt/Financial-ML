# Twin Delayed DDPG
This implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm Twin Delayed DDPG is separated into two folders :
* LEAN : contains the files related to the LEAN framework, which is the framework used on QuantConnect;
* RL : contains the files related to the reinforcement learning algorithm.

The RL algorithm is the implementation of the algorithm discussed in the paper:
